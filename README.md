#This is the repo for my own search_engine. a little test for my learning Python.

The crawler was coded by my own idea, I designed the data structure and coded it.
I think it's useful,but it's not powerful actually.

So, the crawler_with_bs4  was coded on the basis of BeautifulSoup. it's powerful enough for me
Before running it ,you must install bs4 and lxml  with pip.
And I must express my heartfelt thanks to @icodeeu ,his(or her) code on the github helped me a lot.

Maybe the BeautifulSoup and SQlite will work better. So,a new crawler_with_bs4_with_SQlite3.
Beacause of the SQlite,there is a new lookup_wiht_SQlite.
